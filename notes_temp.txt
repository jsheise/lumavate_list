One problem I'm having is using table cells as fields for form entry.
Temporarily will go with standard form entry method.
	ng-form directive?

If I had more time, I would use the Discogs API to fetch album cover information.

After being overwhelmed with information regarding how to design back-end with Python, going to focus on AngularJS and Angular Material.

Initially wanted to do a rating system, but opted for a favorite checkmark instead.

Try to understand $valid and $invalid for forms more.

Want to implement sorting.
